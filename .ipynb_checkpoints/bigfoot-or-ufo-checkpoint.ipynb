       "       'The witness was interviewed by phone on the evening of 01/09/08 and provided the following additional information/observations:The creature crossed the road casually, as if not in a hurry or concerned by the witness' on-coming vehicle.  It took all of 3 steps for the creature to cross the two-lane highway.  The motion was fluid and consistent with natural locomotion.  Estimating height and weight, the witness concluded that the creature was no less than six feet tall, stocky, with a weight of at least 400lbs.  Hair/fur appeared dark in colour with a reddish hue, perhaps 2 inches in length.  Facial features were not noted.  The area of the sighting is just outside Fort Frances where boreal forests, farms, a few residential homes, a lumber yard, and storage facility dot the landscape.  The creature exited the forest on the south side of the highway (having to step out of a ditch), nonchalantly crossed the highway, and entered the forest on the north side of the highway (yet again stepping into and out of a ditch).  The area is teeming with wildlife, including',\n",
       "       'The witness was staying at his grandfather's cabin in Red Gut Bay. He took his dog and went grouse hunting on Indian Island which is situated on Rainy Lake not far from the cabin. He used a long abandoned trail that lead from the waters edge into the interior of the island. Since the trail has not been used for many years, grass about 3 feet high has grown over it. The area is totally secluded and contains all sorts of game such as moose, deer, bear, lynx, rabbits, skunks and lots of blueberry and raspberry bushes.When the witness and his dog came upon the creature, he said that he must have startled it because it had the look of \"surprise\" on its face. He froze in his tracks when he saw this creature rise up from the left side of the trail where the grass meets the brush. He thinks it was possibly lying down or sitting. It rose up and just looked at him. He was approximately 20 - 30 feet from it and describes it as follows',\n",
       "       'The witness, VM, had the sighting early in the moring while driving on a rural side road. He remembers it being extremely cold that morning.He got within 50 feet of the figure. More details about the appearance',\n",
       "       'I spoke with witness on March 6, 2008.  He confirmed the details included in the report, and then added the following details',\n",
       "       'I interviewed the witness and author of this report, G, by phone and also exchanged several emails with him. He made it clear that he has never been too sympathetic to the idea of bigfoot creatures being real. And it was evident that he was having trouble coming to grips with what he and his family experienced near Blind River. Using binoculars he clearly saw an animal he knows was not a bear or a man and which did not fit into his preconceptions of Â“whatÂ’s out there.Â” Despite having seen this animal well and associated with the extraordinary vocalizations, he still couldnÂ’t bring himself to say to me\n",
       " it must have been a sasquatch. He would only say, Â“I donÂ’t know what it was, I just know it wasnÂ’t a bear or a man.Â” Later in his letters G said, Â“You asked the question was this a bear or a man? I am loathe to put a name to what I saw, but it was not a man nor was it a bear. I have seen lots of bears over the years\n",
       " If it was a bear then it was a new species of bear with knees and hands that walks upright. If you have ever seen a black bear walk on its back legs you would know that it is not happy doing it, and it isnÂ’t pretty or smooth. The thing I saw was fluid graceful and just stood up like a person, gave one last look and walked into the bush. ItÂ’s insane and IÂ’m not crazy. What I saw was, to put a word to it, a bigfoot. There, I said it. That bloody thing is real. I can still see its rough appearance and the lighter shade of hair on the legs\n",
       " I will never forget it.Â”He went on to write, Â“I have thought about it almost every day\n",
       " I have to tell you that saying it out loud and telling someone what I saw was an odd experience\n",
       " talking about it caused me some distress, call it acceptance, call it awe, call it fear, it felt odd to openly discuss it\n",
       " denial was not working for me. Personally I was hoping someone somewhere would prove the thing exists and that my mind and my eyes would be vindicated, confirming what I saw and somehow allowing me to come to terms with it\n",
       " The more I think about it and the scale of the thing in regards to the rock it was sitting on\n",
       " something that big just canÂ’t be an illusion.Â”The sounds G and his family heard seem to have been a combination of mechanical sounds (knocking) and varied vocalizations which included something like whistling.G is an audio engineer, one who does pure research. He said this about the sounds',\n",
       "       'The witness is an exceptionally skilled woodsman and hunter.  He is also a very private man who was reluctant to speak about his encounter.  He does not wish to reveal the location of his sighting, except to say that it occurred in northern Ontario.  The following additional information was gathered from numerous communications with him:After falling hard the witness began gathering himself up and saw that an animal had appeared in front of him.  It was \"so close,\" and he reacted instinctively',\n",
       "       'I spoke with the witness over the phone and found him to be very credible. He added a few more important details:Speculation',\n",
       "       'During an interview, the witness provided the following additional details:The bigfoot was about seven feet tall with very broad shoulders and a muscular build.  It had brownish black hair which was thinner on the chest.  Its skin was leathery and had a dark gray to black color.  It had a short, wide nose.  The \"whites\" of the eyes were ash gray and the pupils were large and black.  It had a wide mouth with full, negroid looking lips.The bigfoot was sitting cross-legged (not true Yoga style) and was moving its torso as it reached for different areas in the blueberry patch.  It had blueberries in its hands when it stood, and it walked away from the witness and disappeared into the brush about fifteen to twenty seconds later.Although the bigfoot looked in the direction of the witness immediately before rising, the witness is not positive that the bigfoot actually saw him; it may have just heard him.The witness believes that the bigfoot did not smell him because there was no wind, and because he was using the full line of \"Scent - A - Way\" scent neutralizing products.The witness felt no fear during any part of the sighting.I'm struck by a similarity between this report and Albert Ostman's story of being abducted by a bigfoot in British Columbia in 1924.  In John Green's book \"Sasquatch, The Apes Among Us,\" Albert Ostman stated',\n",
       "       'I spoke with the witness on the telephone and he added the following to his report:-  when he was younger, his family would vacation each summer in the Markdale area to visit his aunt Â– witness resides in the U.S.-  one of his cousins had a turkey farm about a half mile from where the sighting took place-  the time was approximately 11pm when he and his parents were driving back from his cousin's turkey farm Â– they were driving in a north/west direction along W Back Line-  because they were approaching a very sharp corner (see photos), they were traveling at a speed of about 20 miles per hour as they approached the turn-  the road is now paved, but at the time it was a gravel road-  although the embankment has eroded over the years (again, see photos), at the time the witness stated that the embankment was probably between 10-15 feet high - certainly steeper than it is now-  as well, at the time, the area the figure traversed from was a completely wooded area Â– now much of the wooded area has been cleared and a long driveway and a house have been added (see photos below)-  the family was driving a 1962 Cadillac at the time of the sighting, and the witness noted that the side and rear windows of the vehicle were quite large-  as the vehicle approached the sharp turn, the witness saw the figure in the peripheral of the vehicle's headlights Â– the figure was standing at the treeline at the top of the embankment (on the south-east side of W Back Line) and the witness was in disbelief at what he was seeing-  he felt that the figure was not much more than 30 feet away from the car window and he feels that he Â“got a real good look at itÂ”-  as the vehicle passed by the figure, the witness spun around and looked out the back window, and this is when he noticed the figure began to descend off the embankment on its hind legs-  the witness watched it walk down the embankment as the brake lights illuminated the area behind the vehicle Â– there was also light from the lodge across the road (on their left side Â– the west side of W Back Line) -  by the time the vehicle had reached the stop sign, the figure had come down and was standing on the edge of the road - it was just looking towards the vehicle-  witness remembered the following physical details regarding the figure',\n",
       "       'I talked to the witness by phone 8/29/02. He had been fishing alone from a boat in a bay on the Churchill River in Saskatchewan, about 35 miles northwest of La Ronge. He had just landed a big northern pike when he felt something looking at him. He turned and looked and saw a big upright animal standing on shore 70 to 100 yards away looking at him. He made eye contact with it and it turned and walked like a man into the forest. The witness described the animal as tall - probably 8 feet tall - big and muscular. When I asked him if it could have been a bear or a human he said no, that he was sure it was neither. \"What was it then?\" I asked.  \"Well... bigfoot or sasquatch, I guess they call them,\" was his tentative reply. \"A lot of people don't believe they're real.  What do you think?\" I said.  \"Yeah, I saw it. It's real,\" he said.The animal had brown hair, two to three inches long, covering its entire body. The sighting was brief, though, and the witness was quite frightened by the experience. He could provide no further details on the animal's appearance. In talking to witnesses, like this one, who claim to have seen a sasquatch, I've been struck by a couple of things'],\n",
