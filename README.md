## Part 1 - Exploring Beautiful Soup

Dealing with json webscraped data for bigfoot and ufo datasets.

## Part 2 - Converting to Pandas
Each bigfoot and ufo datasets have their own quirks and required lots of trial and error to neatly convert to dataframe.

## Part 3 - Prepping for Classification
Prepping steps taken for both dfs before machine learning.

  * Addressing class imbalance via undersampling.
## Part 4 - Machine Learning

* CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer
* Train-test-split
* Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
  * Bernoulli
  * Multinomial
* Random Forest Classifier
* roc-auc curves and scores
